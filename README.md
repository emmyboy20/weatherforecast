### 💬 Improvement in future
Install moment and use moment for taking currentHour - change next 7days = currentHour + 8h -> export avgtemp_c for each hour in that day


Divide HomeScreen into 3 screens: HomeScreen - SearchingScreen - 7DaysForecast


  -> Already have navigation in app, use it for change each screen

  
  -> Take function temp_c for next 7 days to 7DaysForecast screen

  
  -> Move searchingBar and function to Searching screen

  
Use Redux-toolkit for asynchronous API calls
